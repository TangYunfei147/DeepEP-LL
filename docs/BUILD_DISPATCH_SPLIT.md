# LL dispatch compile partition

The previous low_latency.cpp instantiated seven input/quantization modes inside
one global function. With schema11 timer ON, one Bisheng process handled the
expanded algorithm and all timers for every mode. This change compiles each mode
in its own translation unit, allowing the existing four compiler workers to run
in parallel and reducing the size of each optimized function.

All seven modes remain: prequantized E4M3, FP16 plain/E4M3/E5M2, BF16
plain/E4M3/E5M2. Logical group selection remains the existing compile-time
configuration. Production O2 and Ascend950/dav-3510 stay unchanged.

Host selection uses the same format builder as tiling generation, without D2H
or additional launches. Device entry validates its tiling against the selected
mode. The 152-byte launch arguments and communication protocol14000+S are
unchanged. Internal launch symbol is now dispatch_server_dedup_kernel_do_v2:
install matching Host/device libraries together; old mixed libraries fail symbol
resolution. Timer schema11, initialization/kernel/SyncAll/Flush order and object
lifetimes are preserved; send/count/receive/combine algorithms are unchanged.

Profiler names now end with one of the seven mode names. The ST parser accepts
old and new exact names but rejects mixed variants or task names in one sample
set. It retains the expected sample count and tail selection. No timers have
been removed and no output diagnostics disabled.

## Reproduce cold compilation

After loading CANN and preparing the locked SDK, from the checkout root:

```bash
python tests/ll_stage_timer/benchmark_compile.py --output .logs/cold-on-001 --timer ON --jobs 4
python tests/ll_stage_timer/benchmark_compile.py --output .logs/cold-off-001 --timer OFF --jobs 4
```

Output directories must be new. The timer reports wall time of all dispatch
translation units, including the Host launch bridge, plus per-unit durations.
It excludes SDK preparation, unrelated HT/combine compilation and wheel packaging.
Per-unit times must not be summed and called wall time when compiling in parallel.
A full wheel build is additionally required to validate linkage and Host binding.
No NPU execution is performed by these commands.

## A3_docker measured results (2026-10-21)

Same CANN9.3.0, pinned SDK, S28/R28, G4, O2, dav-3510 and jobs4. Separate empty
object output directories; baseline finished before candidate started.

| Dispatch compilation | Wall seconds | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Original combined entry, timer ON | 784.194 | passed |
| Seven entries + launch bridge, timer ON | 73.501 | passed |
| Seven entries + launch bridge, timer OFF | 55.234 | passed |

Timer ON wall time drops 90.6%, about 10.67x. This combines smaller-function
optimization and translation-unit parallelism; it is not a device performance
result. It excludes SDK/HT/combine/packaging time. Individual ON mode units took
34.78..36.96 seconds; the Host bridge took 2.38 seconds.

Baseline source: d2cc3e3 (9b5f980 only added environment documentation).
Validated candidate: 73b75a7, including concurrent schema11 preflight fix d1d8908.
Remote CPU suite: 305 passed, including actual C++ selector/launch fixtures.
Full timer ON wheel: successfully built and linked. All seven OFF device modes
and the launch bridge: successfully compiled. No NPU execution or wheel install.
Warm unchanged-source rebuild was not run: automatic approval timed out twice.
No claim about measured warm rebuild speed is made.

Remote checkout: /home/tyf/Q4_remote_test/DeepEP-LL-g4-overlap-recv.
Evidence inside that checkout:

- `.logs/compile-split-baseline-002/timing.json` and `low_latency.log`.
- `.logs/compile-split-on-001/timing.json` and per-unit logs.
- `.logs/compile-split-off-001/timing.json` and per-unit logs.
- `.logs/compile-split-wheel.log`; wheel in `.artifacts/compile-split/`.

The first measurement helper failed before compilation because /usr/bin/time
was absent; the checked-in Python runner removes that dependency. The first
candidate CPU pass caught a missing direct ll_core_config.h include in the new
Host bridge; 73b75a7 fixed it before CANN measurements.

## Update on the target

```bash
git pull --ff-only origin kernel/ll-g4-overlap-recv
export DEEPEP_LL_STAGE_TIMER=ON
python -m pip install -v --force-reinstall --no-build-isolation --no-deps .
```

Load the same CANN/environment and core split as before. Reinstall the complete
wheel on all ranks; no SDK rebuild is required solely for this change. Use the
existing ST correctness and observe commands in OVERLAP_RECEIVE.md. The updated
parser recognizes the specialized profiler entry names. Device correctness and
performance remain target-machine validation tasks.
